# This script predicts the horizontal distance travelled by a projectile with the following required information.
# h : height of the end of the barrel in meters
# v0: projectile speed (from previous measurements)
#
# Measured by the board:
# th: angle of the launcher in radians measured by an accelerometer on the board
# v0: projectile speed measured at the photogates
# 
# Setup:
# Two PASCO photo gates are mounted in front of a PASCO projectile launcher. PASCO sells an adapter for this setup.
# The script times the consecutive triggering of the two gates.
# Both photo gate signals are connected to an Adafruit KB2040 pins 28(A2) and 29(A3).
# An accelerometer is connected to the board to automate the angle measurements.
# The board is mounted on top of both gates so it is tilted at the same angle as the launcher.
# When a photo gate is powered, the output is HIGH. When the gate is blocked, it reads LOW.
# When the ball passes through a gate, that gate momentarily outputs LOW, until the ball clears the gate, when the gate will return to HIGH.
# To time the duration of the projectile traveling through the gates, first save the micrsecond tick to time1 when you sense a falling edge (HIGH->LOW) on gate 1 (ball passing gate 1).
# Then save the microsecond tick to time2 when you sense a falling edge (HIGH->LOW) on gate 2 (ball passing gate 2).
# Once you have both time1 and time2 values, subtract time1 from time2 to get the duration of the ball moving between the gates.
# The distance between the gates is 10 cm based on my measurement.
# With the duration, calculate the speed of the ball, and proceed to use this speed and other information and predict the x distance.
# To restart the measurement, restart the script, or wrap the script with a while loop and set time2 to 0 after printing.

# Two methods to sense the photogates are included.
# Method 1: use a while loop to wait until CH1 turns LOW, save time1. Then wait until CH2 turns LOW and save time2.
# Method 2: use interrupts. Each pin has its own interrupt routine to save the tick and then disable the interrupt to prevent overwriting the tick.
# You can disable an interrupt by passing None to it: CH2.irq(None)

# Method 1: While loop. This method has the same average value as PASCO timer, with 0.06ms of variations.
